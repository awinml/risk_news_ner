Layoffs,Twitter,Layoffs Twitter,https://fortune.com/2022/11/18/twitter-former-employee-expenses-not-paid-elon-musk-layoffs/,"When Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk, decided to lay off half the employees of the company he had just bought for $44 billion, it was obvious there would be issues.

But in some cases, those who were told their services were no longer needed have faced a double indignity: They’re owed thousands of dollars from the company with no idea when they will be reimbursed.

The scale of Musk’s layoffs—which have now expanded to firing people who have publicly or privately criticized him—have left former workers in a kind of financial purgatory. And an email ultimatum delivered by Musk to employees demanding they work harder or leave appears to have backfired Thursday evening, leading to a mass exodus and even fewer workers to manage operations at the company.

“People have put in expenses for October, while we were all employed…that have not gone through,” one former Twitter employee in the UK who asked to remain anonymous, and was let go as part of Musk’s initial layoffs in early November, tells Fortune. The employee has around $1,000 in unpaid expenses, but says they know of others who have up to £4,000 ($4,750) in travel expenses that have not been reimbursed.

Those expenses have been incurred on American Express credit cards, and those employees are now on the hook for late payment fees.

Screenshots of days-old discussions on internal company Slack channels reviewed by Fortune show several people asking about missing expense reimbursements, and confused about how the process works for laid off workers.

“I know there are several people in this channel asking, but I’m continuing to get more people on my team asking about what the update is regarding expenses,” one worker wrote.

“Very concerned about how long this is taking,” another worker wrote.

Former employees say that group chats have been filled with ex-colleagues advising people currently owed expenses to pay off any amounts outstanding to avoid late payment card fees—but it’s not that easy.

“Some people are like: ‘I don’t have that money,’” the former UK Twitter employee tells Fortune. “’I was relying on Twitter to give it to me.’ People are in really difficult situations here.”

Payments and expenses at Twitter are submitted through a system called Concur, given pre-approval by an artificial intelligence, then sent to a manager for sign off. If the expense is approved by the manager, it’s then processed and paid out within a week or so.

The expenses some laid-off employees are owed were processed three weeks ago, before Musk took over the company. “Not only has it not [been paid out], but it’s disappeared from Concur,” the former UK employee says. “There are a lot of people in Signal channels very frightened about not getting between £400 to £8,000 of expenses back.”

Former staff have been frantically emailing addresses provided to them after they were cut from the company to try and understand how to get those expenses paid—with no luck.

“Obviously everyone’s been fired,” the former employee says. “So nobody is getting any responses. I don’t know what happens now.”

Earlier this week, Musk sent a middle-of-the-night email to remaining staff telling them that they could either commit to a new “extremely hardcore” work culture at the company, or leave. Around 1,000 to 1,200 additional employees are believed to have left the company as of a Thursday evening ultimatum, and it’s unclear how many people still remain at the social media site.

A current U.S. Twitter employee who still works for the company told Fortune that one of his expense reports had been approved but not paid. Another wasn’t approved by their manager because their manager was laid off.

“The answer we’ve gotten is they’re swamped since everyone rushed to submit expenses once layoffs were known,” he told Fortune. He estimates he’s owed nearly $1,000.

“A lot of people are probably owed a lot [because] many used wellness and learning allowances,” the current Twitter employee said. “Also heard of people that went on off sites or travelled so those may have it worse.”

Twitter does not currently have a communications department, so Fortune could not reach out for comment."
Layoffs,Meta,Layoffs Meta,https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/,"Mark Zuckerberg just shared the following with Meta employees:

Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history. I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.

I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.

How did we get here?

At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I’d expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.

In this new environment, we need to become more capital efficient. We’ve shifted more of our resources onto a smaller number of high priority growth areas — like our AI discovery engine, our ads and business platforms, and our long-term vision for the metaverse. We’ve cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We’re restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won’t bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I’ve also made the hard decision to let people go.

How will this work?

There is no good way to do a layoff, but we hope to get all the relevant information to you as quickly as possible and then do whatever we can to support you through this.

Everyone will get an email soon letting you know what this layoff means for you. After that, every affected employee will have the opportunity to speak with someone to get their questions answered and join information sessions.

Some of the details in the US include:
• Severance . We will pay 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap.
• RSU vesting . Everyone impacted will receive their November 15, 2022 vesting.
• Health insurance . We’ll cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months.
• Career services . We’ll provide three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads.
• Immigration support . I know this is especially difficult if you’re here on a visa. There’s a notice period before termination and some visa grace periods, which means everyone will have time to make plans and work through their immigration status. We have dedicated immigration specialists to help guide you based on what you and your family need.

Outside the US, support will be similar, and we’ll follow up soon with separate processes that take into account local employment laws.

We made the decision to remove access to most Meta systems for people leaving today given the amount of access to sensitive information. But we’re keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell.

While we’re making reductions in every organization across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs, some teams will be affected more than others. Recruiting will be disproportionately affected since we’re planning to hire fewer people next year. We’re also restructuring our business teams more substantially. This is not a reflection of the great work these groups have done, but what we need going forward. The leaders of each group will schedule time to discuss what this means for your team over the next couple of days.

The teammates who will be leaving us are talented and passionate, and have made an important impact on our company and community. Each of you have helped make Meta a success, and I’m grateful for it. I’m sure you’ll go on to do great work at other places.

What other changes are we making?

I view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate. For example, as we shrink our real estate footprint, we’re transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office. We’ll roll out more cost-cutting changes like this in the coming months.

We’re also extending our hiring freeze through Q1 with a small number of exceptions. I’m going to watch our business performance, operational efficiency, and other macroeconomic factors to determine whether and how much we should resume hiring at that point. This will give us the ability to control our cost structure in the event of a continued economic downturn. It will also put us on a path to achieve a more efficient cost structure than we outlined to investors recently.

I’m currently in the middle of a thorough review of our infrastructure spending. As we build our AI infrastructure, we’re focused on becoming even more efficient with our capacity. Our infrastructure will continue to be an important advantage for Meta, and I believe we can achieve this while spending less.

Fundamentally, we’re making all these changes for two reasons: our revenue outlook is lower than we expected at the beginning of this year, and we want to make sure we’re operating efficiently across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs.

How do we move forward?

This is a sad moment, and there’s no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you’ve put into this place. We would not be where we are today without your hard work, and I’m grateful for your contributions.

To those who are staying, I know this is a difficult time for you too. Not only are we saying goodbye to people we’ve worked closely with, but many of you also feel uncertainty about the future. I want you to know that we’re making these decisions to make sure our future is strong.

I believe we are deeply underestimated as a company today. Billions of people use our services to connect, and our communities keep growing. Our core business is among the most profitable ever built with huge potential ahead. And we’re leading in developing the technology to define the future of social connection and the next computing platform. We do historically important work. I’m confident that if we work efficiently, we’ll come out of this downturn stronger and more resilient than ever.

We’ll share more on how we’ll operate as a streamlined organization to achieve our priorities in the weeks ahead. For now, I’ll say one more time how thankful I am to those of you who are leaving for everything you’ve done to advance our mission.

He said it also offered some other employees a voluntary buyout offer.""I've been in this role now for about a year and a half, and without a doubt, this is the most difficult decision we've made during that time (and, we've had to make some very tough calls over the past couple of years, particularly during the heart of the pandemic),"" Jassy wrote in the memo.Seattle-based Amazon, which has been cutting costs in various areas of its business in the past few months, is undergoing an annual review process to figure out where it can save more money. Jassy said this year's review is ""more difficult"" due to the economic landscape and the company's rapid hiring in the last several years.Other tech companies - many of which had gone on hiring binges in the past few years - have also been trimming their workforce amid concerns about an economic slowdown. Among others, Facebook parent Meta said last week it would lay off 11,000 people, about 13% of its workforce. And Elon Musk , the new Twitter CEO, has slashed the company's workforce in half this month.On Tuesday, Amazon notified authorities in California that it would lay off about 260 corporate workers at various facilities. Jassy said Amazon hasn't concluded how many other jobs will be impacted. He noted there will be reductions in certain divisions as the company goes through the annual review process, which will continue into next year. As they weigh job cuts, he said leaders at the company will prioritize what matters most to customers and the long-term health of the company.Amazon is offering severance packages for employees who leave the company. But - unlike Meta, for example - it hasn't publicly provided details of the package.The company employs more than 1.5 million workers globally, primarily made up of hourly workers."

Sexual Harrassment,Meta,Sexual Harrassment Meta,https://nypost.com/2022/05/27/women-are-being-sexually-assaulted-in-the-metaverse/,"Disturbing accounts of women being sexually assaulted and harassed in the metaverse are racking up, according to online watchdogs.

One 21-year-old woman says she was raped within one hour of being in the metaverse, according to a a new report from SumOfUs, a “nonprofit advocacy organization and online community that campaigns to hold corporations accountable” for a variety of alleged infractions.

The report — titled “Metaverse: another cesspool of toxic content” — takes a deep dive into allegations of a woman being “virtually gang raped,” hate speech and content moderation issues at Meta, the controversial rebrand of Facebook Inc.

The young woman, who works as a researcher for the group‚ was led into a private room at a party on “Horizon Worlds,” a metaverse platform released by Meta last December in the US and Canada that allows users to gather with others, play games and build their own virtual worlds.

She has claimed her avatar was then raped by a user while another watched and passed around a virtual bottle of vodka — and others could be seen watching through a window.

In a chilling video clip released by SumOfUs, one avatar is recorded saying, “Check this out. It’s a free show. Oh, getting it. Getting down with that gritty, ya heard.” Meanwhile, the bystander avatar responds with, “You’re gonna need more of this, shorty,” while passing the virtual booze bottle around. “Hey a free show!” the avatar is then heard shouting.

When a user is touched by another in the metaverse, the hand controllers vibrate, “creating a very disorienting and even disturbing physical experience during a virtual assault.”

“It happened so fast I kind of disassociated. One part of my brain was like ‘WTF is happening,’ the other part was like ‘this isn’t a real body,’ and another part was like, ‘this is important research,’ ” the unnamed researcher said in the report.

The watchdog also noted that “VR users have long reported problems with sexual harassment, verbal abuse, racial slurs and invasion of personal space on a myriad of apps.”

“Minimal moderation” in these VR worlds has allowed concerning behavior to “thrive . . . especially towards female-appearing and female-sounding avatars.”

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has waged a high-profile push to shift his company into the metaverse, a fully digital VR environment accessible through headsets or similar technology.

When confronted with the horrific attack that took place in the metaverse, a Meta spokesperson noted that the researcher had turned off the Personal Boundary feature.

The feature was launched in February as a safety tool that’s turned on by default and prevents non-friends from coming within 4 feet of your avatar.

Reps for Meta did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment, but a spokesperson for the company told the Daily Mail: “We don’t recommend turning off the safety feature with people you do not know.”

They also noted several other safety tools intended to help people stay safe while in VR environments, including the Safe Zone button, which allows users to block people who are bothering you and report them or certain inappropriate content.

“We want everyone using our products to have a good experience and easily find the tools that can help in situations like these, so we can investigate and take action,” the Meta spokesperson added.

The SumOfUs report also listed other cases of sexual harassment that have occurred in the metaverse.

An anonymous beta tester for “Horizon Worlds” filed a complaint with the app claiming that her “avatar had been groped by a stranger.”

In 2021, co-founder and VP of metaverse research at Kabuni Nina Jane Patel shared her experience of being “verbally and sexually harassed” within 60 seconds of logging onto “Horizon Worlds.” She reported that three to four male avatars “virtually gang raped” her and took photos shouting crude remarks.

Logging into the “Population One” app, which is owned by Meta, Chanelle Siggens reported being approached by another player, who then “simulated groping and ejaculating onto her avatar.” Another “Population One” user, Mari DeGrazia, reported witnessing harassment more than three times per week while in the app. DeGrazia also experienced abuse herself while wearing a VR vest, when “another player groped her avatar’s chest.”

While exploring the metaverse logged into “Lone Echo VR,” another app owned by Meta, Sydney Smith encountered “lewd, sexist remarks” as another player claimed to have “recorded her [voice]” in order to “jerk off.” After the troubling incident, Smith described having difficulty reporting the player in the game.

SumOfUs stated that the harassment and assaults are not isolated to Meta-owned apps but noted that many of the apps are accessible through the Meta Oculus Quest headset.

The report noted three key measures that should be taken to regulate the VR universe.
• First, according to the report, “regulators must address the predatory, anticompetitive practices of Mark Zuckerberg.”
• Second, it is “alarming that, to this day, the US has no adequate data protection laws to safeguard consumers against abusive data harvesting practices across platforms, allowing companies like Meta to sell data to 3rd parties with little oversight.”
• Third, as the Digital Services Act (DSA) gets written into law in Europe, other world governments “must use this landmark legislation as a blueprint for how to regulate Big Tech companies in their own jurisdictions.”

Another report found that incidents of sexual harassment and assault in the metaverse are commonly met with “dismissive, abusive and misogynistic” responses, according to MIT Technology Review.

However, on a larger scale, the majority of American adults agree that online harassment is a problem, with 41% saying they have experienced some form of harassment in digital spaces, a Pew Research study found.

Jesse Fox, an associate professor at Ohio State University who researches the social implications of virtual reality, told the MIT outlet, “People should keep in mind that sexual harassment has never had to be a physical thing. It can be verbal, and yes, it can be a virtual experience as well.”"
